## Technologies used
  I created this project to get some hands-on experience with React and Tailwind. Used Vite as the project template, React and Tailwind.

### Learnings for me
 - Implemented React core features like hooks, conditional rendering, iterating through JSON data.
 - Used several React hooks like useState to manage state, useEffect to update localStorage only when the data changes , createContext and useContext to pass down values and prevent prop drilling
 - Made use of various Tailwind classes for styling, implementing responsive design, hover/active pseudo-classes
